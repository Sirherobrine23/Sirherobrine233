Creator and Maintainer of Bds Maneger Project. My goal is to deliver open software so that it can be used by anyone inside and outside my projects.

Have several ideas, most of them I managed to make, and bring the audiences for everyone to use.

An example is the Bds Maneger Core in which I created a package that manages the servers for Minecraft in both the Java version and the Bedrock version.
