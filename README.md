# A summary about me

I am a young Javascript programmer, with a large base in Linux and Docker.

I have in mind that I can turn that boring content into something that everyone uses, in addition to being an open source lover.

Today I have a project (@bds-maneger) that I had to rewrite from the Shell Script for Javascript and rethink how everything can work in any language with a little effort.
